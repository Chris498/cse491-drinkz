Party Planning

        Story:
Susie is attending a party that her friend Bob is hosting. Bob wants to know what kind of music Susie and the other guests
would like to hear. Susie wants to hear a certain kind of music so she needs a place to post her requests.

        Features:
1. Storage of songs, artists, and albums will be necessary by using an inventory/library of music.
2. A web interface that allows the host to communicate with the guests. This could include a form that guests can fill out in order to
request songs.
3. Another web page might display the top song choices of the guests.

        Data Storage Fucntionality:
A music object will consist of (song, artist, album) in its constructor. By leaving one of the 3 fields blank, the field will be set
to null. All of these music object will be stored into a music library. The music library will consist of the guests name as the key
and the music object as the value. This should be able to be accomplished by the use of forms and jinja2 templating. The web page that
displays the mucisc requests will loop throught the music library and display each music request. Adding and retrieving music object will
have to be implemented.
